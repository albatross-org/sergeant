# DESIGN
This document is about working towards a `v1` of the program and contains working information about needed improvements and potential new features.

## Current Issues
- [ ] A lack of flexibility around the study UI. Currently it's very easy to accidentally click one of the completion buttons and have it store the incorrect result forever. An accidental refresh also means that the current question is lost.
- [ ] There are no tests and there is little to no documentation.
- [ ] It's very clunky to get working, all the configuration has to be done via the config file rather than the website.
- [ ] Git doesn't work for scanning questions in.
